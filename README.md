# scRNAseq_Lung-Fibrosis-Analysis
This repo contains the pre-processing and analysis files to uncover the role of ANTXR1 in the progression, development and resolution of lung fibrosis. The datasets are obtained with credit to the original authors from GEO database. The datasets that are used here are: [GSE250396](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE250396), [GSE264162](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi), [GSE264278](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi). We are interested in exploring the changes that occur globally and genetically in the single-cell resolution over time. We hypothesize that the change in ANTXR1 expression can be correlated with changes with lung fibroblasts, which are determined to be the affected cell type in triggering fibrotic repair mechanisms during the course of injury.
